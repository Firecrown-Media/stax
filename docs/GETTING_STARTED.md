# Getting Started with Stax

Welcome to Stax! This guide will help you set up your WordPress development environment in under 10 minutes.

## What is Stax?

Stax is a powerful CLI tool that streamlines WordPress development workflows. It integrates with DDEV for local development and WPEngine for database synchronization, making it easy to work with WordPress sites (single site or multisite).

### What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- Stax installed and configured
- A local WordPress development environment running
- Database synced from WPEngine (optional)
- Understanding of daily development workflow

**Estimated time:** 10-15 minutes

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Docker Desktop** - Installed and running
   - Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   - Must be running before using Stax

2. **DDEV** - Local development environment
   ```bash
   brew install ddev
   ```

3. **WPEngine Account** (Optional but recommended)
   - SSH access to your WPEngine install
   - Useful for database synchronization

4. **GitHub Repository Access** (Optional)
   - If working with an existing codebase

---

## Installation

### Install via Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the Stax tap
brew install firecrown-media/tap/stax

# Verify installation
stax --version
```

You should see output like:
```
stax version 2.0.0
Git Commit: ...
Build Date: ...
```

### Build from Source (Advanced)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecrown-media/stax.git
cd stax
go build -o stax main.go
sudo mv stax /usr/local/bin/
```

---

## Quick Start Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up Credentials (Optional)

If you plan to sync databases from WPEngine, configure your credentials:

```bash
stax setup
```

**What this does:**
- Prompts for WPEngine username and password
- Stores credentials securely in macOS Keychain (for builds from source) or config file (for Homebrew installs)
- Can be skipped if doing local-only development

**Prerequisites for WPEngine API Access:**
- Your WPEngine account must have API access enabled (requires Owner role)
- See [WPEngine Credentials Guide](WPENGINE.md#getting-your-wpengine-api-credentials) for detailed setup instructions
- Official guide: [Enabling WPEngine API](https://wpengine.com/support/enabling-wp-engine-api/)

**Example interaction:**
```
? WPEngine Username: your-username
? WPEngine Password: ********
✓ Credentials saved to macOS Keychain
```

**Don't have API access?** Check your account permissions or contact your WPEngine account owner to enable API access. See the [WPEngine Credentials Guide](WPENGINE.md#getting-your-wpengine-api-credentials) for help.

---

### Step 2: List Available Sites (Optional)

See which WPEngine installations you have access to:

```bash
stax list
```

**Example output:**
```
Available WPEngine Installations:
- mysite-prod (Production)
- mysite-staging (Staging)
- anothersite-prod (Production)
```

This helps you choose which install to sync with your local environment.

---

### Step 3: Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory (or create a new one) and run:

```bash
# Create and navigate to project directory
mkdir my-wordpress-site && cd my-wordpress-site

# Run interactive initialization
stax init
```

**What happens during `stax init`:**
1. Interactive prompts guide you through configuration
2. Creates `.stax.yml` configuration file
3. Sets up DDEV environment (`.ddev/config.yaml`)
4. Optionally clones your GitHub repository
5. Starts the environment automatically
6. Downloads WordPress core automatically
7. Generates wp-config.php with database credentials
8. Optionally pulls database from WPEngine
9. Your site is immediately accessible!

**Example prompts and answers:**

```
? Project name: my-wordpress-site
? Project type: wordpress (or wordpress-multisite)
? PHP version: 8.1
? MySQL version: 8.0
? GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/myorg/mysite.git (or leave blank)
? Branch: main
? WPEngine install: mysite-prod (select from list)
? WPEngine environment: production
? Start environment now? Yes
? Pull database now? Yes
```

**After initialization:**
```
✓ Created .stax.yml
✓ Created DDEV configuration
✓ Repository cloned
✓ Environment started
✓ WordPress core downloaded
✓ wp-config.php generated
✓ Database pulled and imported

Your site is ready at: https://my-wordpress-site.ddev.site

No manual setup required - everything is configured and ready to use!
```

---

### Step 4: Use Your Environment

Now that your environment is running, you can use these commands:

#### Check Status

```bash
stax status
```

Shows comprehensive information:
- Project name and type
- Primary URL
- Container status (web, database, router)
- PHP and database versions
- Xdebug status
- Mailhog URL for testing emails

#### Stop Environment

```bash
# Stop current project
stax stop

# Stop all DDEV projects
stax stop --all
```

#### Start Again

```bash
# Basic start
stax start

# Start with Xdebug enabled
stax start --xdebug

# Start and run build
stax start --build
```

#### Check System Health

```bash
stax doctor
```

Diagnoses issues and provides solutions:
- Docker availability
- DDEV installation
- Configuration validity
- Port conflicts
- Disk space
- Credentials

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Project from WPEngine

Start with a WPEngine site and create local environment:

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-site && cd my-site

# Initialize with WPEngine integration (one command!)
stax init --start

# Answer prompts:
# - Project name: my-site
# - WPEngine install: mysite-prod
# - Pull database: Yes

# Your environment is now running with:
# ✓ WordPress core downloaded
# ✓ Database configured
# ✓ WPEngine database imported
# ✓ Site immediately accessible!
```

---

### Workflow 2: Existing Git Repository

Clone an existing WordPress repository and set up local environment:

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-site && cd my-site

# Initialize with repository (one command!)
stax init --start

# Answer prompts:
# - Repository: https://github.com/org/repo.git
# - WPEngine install: mysite-prod
# - Pull database: Yes

# Repository cloned and environment started!
# ✓ WordPress core downloaded
# ✓ wp-config.php generated
# ✓ Database imported
# ✓ Everything ready to go!
```

---

### Workflow 3: Local Only (No WPEngine)

Set up a local WordPress environment without WPEngine integration:

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-site && cd my-site

# Initialize without WPEngine
stax init --start

# Answer prompts:
# - Skip WPEngine setup (leave install name blank)
# - Use defaults for DDEV configuration

# Local-only environment created!
# ✓ WordPress core downloaded
# ✓ wp-config.php generated
# ✓ Fresh WordPress installation ready
```

---

### Workflow 4: Import Existing DDEV Project

Already have a DDEV project? Add Stax features:

```bash
# Navigate to existing DDEV project
cd /path/to/existing/ddev/project

# Import into Stax
stax init --from-ddev

# Optionally add WPEngine integration
# Creates .stax.yml from your DDEV settings

# Now you can use all Stax commands!
```

---

## Daily Development

### Starting Your Day

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/projects/my-site

# Start the environment
stax start

# Your site opens automatically in browser
# → https://my-site.ddev.site
```

---

### Syncing Database

Pull the latest database from WPEngine:

```bash
# Pull database (creates backup first)
stax db pull

# Pull without backup (faster)
stax db pull --skip-backup
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates local snapshot (unless skipped)
2. Downloads database from WPEngine
3. Imports into local DDEV database
4. Runs search-replace for local URLs
5. Shows completion message

---

### Running Builds

Build your theme and plugin assets:

```bash
# One-time build
stax build

# Development mode with file watching
stax dev

# Development mode for specific theme
stax dev --theme=my-theme
```

---

### Working with WordPress

Run WP-CLI commands:

```bash
# List plugins
stax wp -- plugin list

# Update WordPress
stax wp -- core update

# Run search-replace
stax wp -- search-replace 'oldurl.com' 'my-site.ddev.site'

# Any WP-CLI command
stax wp -- <command>
```

---

### Working with Remote Media (No Download Needed)

One of Stax's most powerful features is the ability to use production media files without downloading them to your local machine.

**The Problem:**
Production WordPress sites often have tens or hundreds of gigabytes of media files (images, videos, PDFs, etc.) in the `wp-content/uploads/` directory. Downloading all of these for local development:
- Takes hours or even days
- Wastes valuable disk space
- Requires constant re-syncing as new media is added
- Is often unnecessary since you rarely modify most media files

**The Solution: Media Proxy**

Stax can configure nginx to automatically fetch media files from WPEngine or a CDN on-demand, only when your browser requests them. This is called "media proxying."

**How it works:**
1. Your browser requests an image from your local site
2. nginx checks if the file exists locally
3. If not found locally, nginx transparently fetches it from WPEngine/CDN
4. The image displays normally in your browser
5. Optionally, the file is cached locally for faster subsequent loads

**Setting up media proxy:**

```bash
# Setup media proxy (uses WPEngine from .stax.yml)
stax media setup-proxy

# Or specify a CDN URL
stax media setup-proxy --cdn=https://mysite.b-cdn.net

# With custom cache duration
stax media setup-proxy --cache-ttl=7d
```

**Expected output:**
```
Setting Up Media Proxy
✓ Using BunnyCDN from config: https://mysite.b-cdn.net
✓ Using WPEngine from config: https://mysite.wpengine.com
✓ Generating nginx media proxy configuration
✓ DDEV restarted

Media proxy configured successfully!

Configuration Summary
  Primary Source:  https://mysite.b-cdn.net
  Fallback Source: https://mysite.wpengine.com
  Caching:         ✓ Enabled
  Cache TTL:       30d
```

**Check status:**
```bash
stax media status
```

**Test it works:**
```bash
stax media test
```

**Verify in browser:**
1. Visit your local site
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Navigate to a page with images
4. Click on an image request
5. Look for `X-Proxy-Source: cdn` or `X-Proxy-Source: wpengine` in response headers
6. First load shows `X-Cache-Status: MISS`
7. Subsequent loads show `X-Cache-Status: HIT` (served from cache)

**When to use media proxy:**
- You don't need to modify media files locally
- Your uploads directory is very large (10GB+)
- You have a reliable internet connection
- You want faster project setup
- You want to save disk space

**When to download files instead:**
- You need to test WordPress upload functionality
- You're working offline
- You need to modify specific media files
- Your internet connection is slow/unreliable

**Hybrid approach:**

You can use media proxy AND selectively download specific files you need:

```bash
# Enable media proxy for most files
stax media setup-proxy

# Download specific directory you need to modify
rsync -avz user@wpengine:/path/to/uploads/2024/11/ ./wp-content/uploads/2024/11/
```

nginx will serve the local files when they exist, and proxy everything else.

**Disabling media proxy:**

If you later decide to download all media and stop using the proxy:

```bash
# Download all media files
stax provider sync uploads

# Or manually configure in .stax.yml
# Set media.proxy.enabled: false
# Then restart
stax restart
```

### Stopping Environment

When you're done for the day:

```bash
# Stop current project
stax stop

# Stop all DDEV projects
stax stop --all

# Stop and remove data (destructive)
stax stop --remove-data
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "stax: command not found"

**Problem:** Stax is not installed or not in PATH

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install firecrown-media/tap/stax

# Or add to PATH if built from source
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

---

### "Docker is not running"

**Problem:** Docker Desktop is not started

**Solution:**
1. Open Docker Desktop application
2. Wait for it to fully start (whale icon stops animating)
3. Run `stax doctor` to verify
4. Try your command again

---

### "No project configuration found"

**Problem:** Neither `.stax.yml` nor `.ddev/config.yaml` exists

**Solution:**
```bash
# Initialize the project
stax init

# Or if you just want DDEV
ddev config --project-type=wordpress
stax start
```

---

### "Port already in use"

**Problem:** Required ports (80, 443, 3306, etc.) are in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run diagnostics
stax doctor

# Shows which ports are in use
# Stop conflicting services:
# - Apache: sudo apachectl stop
# - MySQL: brew services stop mysql
# - Other DDEV projects: stax stop --all

# Or change ports in .ddev/config.yaml
```

---

### "Failed to pull database"

**Problem:** WPEngine credentials invalid, network issue, or permissions problem

**Common credential-related failures:**
- **Invalid credentials** - Username or password incorrect
- **API access not enabled** - Account doesn't have API access (requires Owner role)
- **Insufficient permissions** - User role doesn't have access to the install
- **Network connectivity** - Can't reach WPEngine servers

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reconfigure credentials
stax setup

# Verify credentials are correct
stax list

# Check WPEngine install name and permissions
# Make sure you have SSH access to the install
```

ddev clean

# 3. Check disk space
df -h

# 4. Try starting again
stax start
```

---

### Configuration Issues

**Problem:** Something wrong with `.stax.yml` or DDEV config

**Solution:**
```bash
# Validate your configuration
stax validate

# Shows what's wrong and how to fix it

# If config is broken, regenerate:
stax init
```
