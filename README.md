## What is Stax?

Stax is a command-line tool that makes WordPress development simple and consistent. Whether you're working on a single site or multisite network, Stax integrates with DDEV for local development and WPEngine for database synchronization.

**What Stax provides:**
- Complete environment management (start, stop, restart, status)
- Automatic database sync from WPEngine
- Support for both single site and multisite
- System diagnostics and health checks
- Configuration validation
- Secure credential storage (macOS Keychain)
- Build automation
- WP-CLI integration

## Key Features

- **One-Command Setup** - Go from zero to running WordPress in under 5 minutes
- **Single Site & Multisite** - Full support for standard WordPress and multisite networks
- **Automatic Database Sync** - Pull databases from WPEngine with automatic URL replacement
- **Multisite Made Easy** - Full support for subdomain and subdirectory multisite (when needed)
- **Remote Media Proxying** - Serve production media from WPEngine or CDN without downloading files. nginx automatically fetches images on-demand, saving 10GB-200GB of disk space and hours of sync time. Optional caching for fast performance.
- **Safe Database Snapshots** - Create restore points before risky operations
- **Team-Friendly** - Share configuration files via Git, everyone gets identical environments
- **Build Automation** - Automatically runs Composer, npm, and build scripts
- **Secure Credentials** - Stores API keys and passwords safely in macOS Keychain

## Quick Start

Get started with Stax in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Install Stax
brew install firecrown-media/tap/stax

# 2. Set up credentials (optional)
stax setup

# 3. Initialize your project
mkdir my-wordpress-site && cd my-wordpress-site
stax init

# 4. Your environment is now running!
stax status
```

See [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed walkthrough.

## Who Should Use Stax?

## How It Works

Stax uses industry-standard, battle-tested tools:

1. **DDEV** - Manages Docker containers for WordPress, MySQL, and other services
2. **WP-CLI** - Handles WordPress operations and database imports
3. **WPEngine API** - Pulls databases and syncs files from your hosting
4. **macOS Keychain** - Securely stores your credentials
5. **Git** - Clones your repositories and manages code

When you run `stax init`, here's what happens:

```
1. Validates your WPEngine credentials
2. Clones your GitHub repository
3. Detects PHP/MySQL versions from WPEngine
4. Generates DDEV configuration
5. Starts Docker containers
6. Installs Composer and npm dependencies
7. Runs your build scripts
8. Pulls the database from WPEngine
9. Imports and runs search-replace automatically
10. Displays your local URLs

Total time: 2-5 minutes
```

## Real-World Examples

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Monday morning
cd ~/Sites/firecrown-multisite
stax start                    # Start your environment (10 seconds)

# Pull latest database from staging
stax db pull --environment=staging

# Work on a feature
git checkout -b feature/new-header
# ... make changes ...

# Test your changes
stax wp cache flush
open https://mysite.local

# End of day
stax stop
```

### Testing with Production Data

```bash
# Create a snapshot before testing
stax db snapshot before-testing

# Pull production database
stax db pull --environment=production

# Test your migration script
stax wp db query --file=migration.sql

# Something broke? No problem!
stax db restore before-testing
```

### Onboarding a New Team Member

```bash
# New developer's machine
git clone https://github.com/mycompany/my-project.git
cd my-project

# One-time setup
stax setup

# Project is ready!
stax init

# That's it! They have the exact same environment
```

**More examples:** [docs/EXAMPLES.md](./docs/EXAMPLES.md)

## Single Site Support

Stax works great with standard single-site WordPress installations:

```yaml
# .stax.yml
project:
  name: my-site
  type: wordpress  # Single site

wordpress:
  domain: mysite.local
```

All the same features work for single sites:
- Automatic database sync from WPEngine
- Remote media proxying
- Database snapshots and restore
- Build automation
- Team-friendly configuration

**Perfect for:** Most WordPress projects, client sites, blogs, marketing sites, or any standard WordPress installation.

## Multisite Support (Optional)

Need multisite? Stax has first-class support for WordPress multisite networks in both modes:

### Subdomain Multisite

```yaml
# .stax.yml
project:
  mode: subdomain

network:
  domain: mynetwork.local
  sites:
    - name: site1
      domain: site1.mynetwork.local
    - name: site2
      domain: site2.mynetwork.local
```

Stax automatically:
- Configures wildcard SSL certificates
- Sets up DNS resolution for all subdomains
- Runs search-replace for each subsite
- Generates proper WordPress multisite config

### Subdirectory Multisite

```yaml
# .stax.yml
project:
  mode: subdirectory

network:
  domain: mynetwork.local
  sites:
    - name: site1
      path: /site1
    - name: site2
      path: /site2
```

Works seamlessly with both modes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts**
```bash
# Check if ports are in use
stax doctor

# Fix: Stop conflicting services
sudo apachectl stop
```

**Database connection errors**
```bash
# Restart DDEV services
stax restart
```

**SSL certificate issues**
```bash
# DDEV uses mkcert - this is automatic
# If you see SSL errors, check:
ddev --version  # Make sure DDEV is up to date
```

**Can't access subsites**
```bash
# Check your configuration
stax config list

# Restart to regenerate DDEV config
stax restart
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does Stax work on Windows or Linux?**
A: Currently Stax is macOS-only. Windows and Linux support may come in the future.

**Q: Can I use Stax with other hosting providers?**
A: Stax has built-in WPEngine support, but you can use it as a local development tool with any hosting provider. Database sync would be manual.

**Q: How is this different from wp-env or other tools?**
A: Stax is specifically designed for WordPress development (both single sites and multisite) with hosting integration. It's more opinionated and automated than general-purpose tools, with first-class support for WPEngine.

**Q: Do I need to download all my media files?**
A: No! Stax uses remote media proxying - it fetches media from your CDN/production server on-demand.

**Q: Can multiple team members use different configurations?**
A: The `.stax.yml` file is meant to be shared via Git for consistency. Personal preferences go in `~/.stax/config.yml`.
